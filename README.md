# 455-Gibbs-Sampling

Hello people! You have reached the github repository for Gibbs Sampling project from Kristy Ma and Regan Brodine. Our project is based on STAT/MATH 455: Mathematical Statistics course (S23) and it explains this cool MCMC algorithm to draw posterior samples with multiple (possibly infinite) dimensions, and it ties with a cool application in statistical genetics to infer genotypes in unknown population groups with Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. Our distill webpage: https://kristywhim.github.io/455-Gibbs-Sampling/

Feel free to explore! With any questions/ typos (or reaching out for the rmd file on simulation activity), please feel free reach out to kristy20011001@gmail.com (Kristy), or rbrodine@macalester.edu (Regan).

Thank you for the interest!!
