# Hi!
Welcome to our project page on Gibbs Sampling - an example of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that uses conditional probabilities to iteratively draw posterior samples for estimating the probabiltiy distribution of unknown parameters. This also ties with a cool application in statistical genetics to infer genotypes in unknown population groups with Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. 

To start exploring, simply navigate to tabs on the upper right corner:

1) "Home": This page
2) "Intro to Bayesian": Bayesian philosophy; Bayes rules; Posterior Exercise
3) "Gibbs Sampling": Gibbs Sampling Background; Properties and Limitations; Gibbs Sampling and MCMC; Simulation Example of Gibbs Sampler
4) "Applications": Gibbs Sampling in statistical genetics
5) "Wrap-up": Outro!

> Learning Goals:
1.  Be able to explain what Gibbs Sampling is and when to use it.
2.  In addition to knowing the uses of Gibbs sampling, understand the limitations of Gibbs sampling, and what properties of trace plots evidence good performance.
3.  Simulate data from Gibbs sampling framework using R
4.  Understand that Gibbs sampling is a special scenario of Metropolis Hasting with acceptance rate = 1
5.  Get to know the application of Gibbs sampler in Statistical Genetics


**Have fun!**
